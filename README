GWT Web Checker
A web monitor over GWT and GAE

Futere features 
- Manual checking of the availability of an url from GAE servers
- Signed users can insert a range of url and app will check them
  periodically.
- Email notifications
- Availability charts

At this moment GWT Web Checker is completely useless. I'm
using GitHub just as CVS to share this project between my 
computers.

I hope to have a semi functional version in the near future
